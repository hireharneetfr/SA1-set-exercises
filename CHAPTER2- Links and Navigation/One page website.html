<h2><b>Overview </b></h2>

<p>Eiichiro Oda is the creator of one of the most known Japanese manga series, 'One Piece'. First published in 1997, it became one of the best selling manga series globally. The story focuses on Monkey D. Luffy, a young pirate who has an extraordinary ability to stretch his body like rubber after it swallowed a mystical fruit called Devil Fruit. Luffy's goal is to come and discover the legendary treasure The "One Piece" and become the King of The Pirates.Besides the manga, One Piece is also adapted into a highly successful anime series, starting from 1999. However, it has been ongoing for years, and has amassed a massive fan base all throughout the world, which, accordingly, made One Piece one of the longest-running anime TV shows of all time.</p>
<p>In One Piece, Devil Fruits are rare, mystical fruits that grant unique powers at the cost of losing the ability to swim. They are divided into three types: Paramecia, which alters the body or grants special abilities; Logia, which allows control over natural elements; and Zoan, which enables animal transformations. These fruits play a key role in the series, shaping the battles and adventures of many characters.</p>

<h2> <b>Concept and Plot</b></h2>
<p>Monkey D Luffy is a young and adventurous pirate with a big dream and the wish is to find the legendary sought after, the “One Piece” so he can become King of the Pirates. Frustrated with his life, as a child, he decided to idolize the pirate captain “Red-Haired” Shanks, who unknowingly started his journey, when Luffy ate the mysterious Gum-Gum Fruit. Luffy, however, got a Devil Fruit that gave him a rubbery body in return for the ability to stretch and bounce, but with an extremely high price - his ability to swim was lost. At 17 undeterred, Luffy sets sail alone to discover the world, battle against the greatest foes, and make his dream a reality. </p>  

<p>Along the way Luffy scatters a varied crew of Straw Hat Pirates (after the straw hat Shanks had given him). They fight and take on corrupt governments, warlords and then fear pirate leaders, but each member has their own dreams, and they have each other, united by luffy's leadership. Their adventures cover many islands to the point their journey toward the One Piece is littered with allies and enemies and all the challenges they bring to their adventure.</p>
