<br>
<p id="def">One piece has more then 1000 episodes but my favorite of it all was the 'MarineFord Arc'.</p>
<br>
<p id="def">One of the most destructive and highly action battle in One Piece, the Marineford Arc is definitely a close to points in Luffy’s journey. 
        Because he found out that his brother, Portgas D. Ace, was caught up by the Marines and will be sentenced to execution, Luffy has escaped 
        Impel Down exhausted, but he still goes to the deadliest battlefield — Marineford — to save him. Weak as the monstrous forces present, Luffy 
        had no other family but his crew and he was alone and apart from them. Whitebeard and his entire pirate fleet clash with the Marines, Admirals,
         Warlords in a chaotic and bloody brawl. Alongside legendary figures, Luffy had fought beyond all limits to free Ace, and with the victory 
         beginning to settle upon them, Admiral Akainu instigated dropping the dead body of Ace in front of Luffy’s eyes, killing him in favor. 
         Grief overcame him and Luffy could not protect his only brother, and recognising the harsh truth, he was still too weak to stand against
          the world’s strongest. Luffy was shattered and lost, as Blackbeard rose and terrorised the world with his name replacing Whitebeard’s. 
          But this moment of despair brought him to a new direction; he needed to become stronger, not just for himself, but for his crew, 
          his family, and the dream he carried forward.</p>
