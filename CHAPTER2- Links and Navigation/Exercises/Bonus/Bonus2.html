<h2 id="abc"> OVERVIEW</h2>

<p id="def">Eiichiro Oda is the creator of one of the most known Japanese manga series, 'One Piece'. First published in 1997, it became one of the best selling manga series globally. The story focuses on Monkey D. Luffy, a young pirate who has an extraordinary ability to stretch his body like rubber after it swallowed a mystical fruit called Devil Fruit. Luffy's goal is to come and discover the legendary treasure The "One Piece" and become the King of The Pirates.Besides the manga, One Piece is also adapted into a highly successful anime series, starting from 1999. However, it has been ongoing for years, and has amassed a massive fan base all throughout the world, which, accordingly, made One Piece one of the longest-running anime TV shows of all time.</p>
<br>
<p id="def">In One Piece, Devil Fruits are rare, mystical fruits that grant unique powers at the cost of losing the ability to swim. They are divided into three types: Paramecia, which alters the body or grants special abilities; Logia, which allows control over natural elements; and Zoan, which enables animal transformations. These fruits play a key role in the series, shaping the battles and adventures of many characters.</p>
