<h2 id="abc">DEVIL FRUITS</h2>
<br>
<p id="def">In the One Piece world, Devil Fruits are important as it gives people extraordinary powers when eaten. The range in which these abilities could be is that they can control elements, change into animals and even transform a userâ€™s body in a strange way. As the downside, however, those who have eaten a Devil Fruit lose the ability to swim and are hence helpless in water. 
    And of course, all these fruits bring an ongoing power struggle in the series in order for the characters to acquire them to have more power or to have an edge in the battle. Devil Fruits are important in the One Piece world as they are very powerful fruits which can grant one extraordinary powers once they consume it. What makes the impact so great: Its influence in the world, making a core in the story and affecting many of key character in the story. They are classified into three main types: Paramecia, Logia, and Zoan.</p>
