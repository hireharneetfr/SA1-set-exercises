<h2> <b>Concept and Plot</b></h2>
<p>Monkey D Luffy is a young and adventurous pirate with a big dream and the wish is to find the legendary sought after, the “One Piece” 
    so he can become King of the Pirates. Frustrated with his life, as a child, he decided to idolize the pirate captain “Red-Haired” Shanks, 
    who unknowingly started his journey, when Luffy ate the mysterious Gum-Gum Fruit. Luffy, however, got a Devil Fruit that gave him a rubbery 
    body in return for the ability to stretch and bounce, but with an extremely high price - his ability to swim was lost. At 17 undeterred, 
    Luffy sets sail alone to discover the world, battle against the greatest foes, and make his dream a reality. </p>  

<p>Along the way Luffy scatters a varied crew of Straw Hat Pirates (after the straw hat Shanks had given him). They fight and take on corrupt
     governments, warlords and then fear pirate leaders, but each member has their own dreams, and they have each other, united by luffy's 
     leadership. Their adventures cover many islands to the point their journey toward the One Piece is littered with allies and enemies and
     all the challenges they bring to their adventure.</p>
