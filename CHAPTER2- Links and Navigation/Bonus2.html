<p id="def">Eiichiro Oda is the creator of one of the most known Japanese manga series, 'One Piece'. First published in 1997, it became one of the best selling manga series globally. The story focuses on Monkey D. Luffy, a young pirate who has an extraordinary ability to stretch his body like rubber after it swallowed a mystical fruit called Devil Fruit.

<p id="def">In One Piece, Devil Fruits are rare, mystical fruits that grant unique powers at the cost of losing the ability to swim. They are divided into three types: Paramecia, which alters the body or grants special abilities; Logia, which allows control over natural elements; and Zoan, which enables animal transformations.

<h2> <b>Concept and Plot</b></h2>
<p>Monkey D Luffy is a young and adventurous pirate with a big dream and the wish is to find the legendary sought after, the “One Piece” so he can become King of the Pirates. Frustrated with his life, as a child, he decided to idolize the pirate captain “Red-Haired” Shanks, who unknowingly started his journey, when Luffy ate the mysterious Gum-Gum Fruit. Luffy, however, got a Devil Fruit that gave him a rubbery body in return for the ability to stretch and bounce, but with an extremely high price - his ability to swim was lost. At 17 undeterred, Luffy sets sail alone to discover the world, battle against the greatest foes, and make his dream a reality. </p>  

<p>Along the way Luffy scatters a varied crew of Straw Hat Pirates (after the straw hat Shanks had given him). They fight and take on corrupt governments, warlords and then fear pirate leaders, but each member has their own dreams, and they have each other, united by luffy's leadership. Their adventures cover many islands to the point their journey toward the One Piece is littered with allies and enemies and all the challenges they bring to their adventure.</p>

<h2><b>Devil Fruits</b></h2>
<p>In the One Piece world, Devil Fruits are important as it gives people extraordinary powers when eaten. The range in which these abilities could be is that they can control elements, change into animals and even transform a user’s body in a strange way. As the downside, however, those who have eaten a Devil Fruit lose the ability to swim and are hence helpless in water. 
    And of course, all these fruits bring an ongoing power struggle in the series in order for the characters to acquire them to have more power or to have an edge in the battle. Devil Fruits are important in the One Piece world as they are very powerful fruits which can grant one extraordinary powers once they consume it. What makes the impact so great: Its influence in the world, making a core in the story and affecting many of key character in the story. They are classified into three main types: Paramecia, Logia, and Zoan.</p>
<ul>
    <li> <b>Paramecia</b> fruits grant users special abilities that alter their bodies or surroundings. These are the most common and can range from simple enhancements to reality-warping powers. <br>
        Example: The Gomu Gomu no Mi gives Luffy a rubber-like body.</li>
        <br>
    <li><b>Logia</b> fruits allow users to transform into and control natural elements like fire, ice, or darkness, making them nearly untouchable. <br>
        Example: The Mera Mera no Mi lets the user create and manipulate fire.</li>
        <br>

    <li><b>Zoan</b> fruits enable users to transform into animals or hybrid forms, increasing their strength and agility. Some Zoan fruits can even grant mythical or ancient transformations. <br>
        Example: The Uo Uo no Mi, Model: Seiryu allows Kaido to transform into a giant dragon.</li>

<section id="review">
<h2><b>Review By Me</b></h2>
<p>One piece has more then 1000 episodes but my favorite of it all was the 'MarineFord Arc'.</p>
<p>One of the most destructive and highly action battle in One Piece, the Marineford Arc is definitely a close to points in Luffy’s journey. 
    Because he found out that his brother, Portgas D. Ace, was caught up by the Marines and will be sentenced to execution, Luffy has escaped 
    Impel Down exhausted, but he still goes to the deadliest battlefield — Marineford — to save him. Weak as the monstrous forces present, Luffy 
    had no other family but his crew and he was alone and apart from them. Whitebeard and his entire pirate fleet clash with the Marines, Admirals,
     Warlords in a chaotic and bloody brawl. Alongside legendary figures, Luffy had fought beyond all limits to free Ace, and with the victory 
     beginning to settle upon them, Admiral Akainu instigated dropping the dead body of Ace in front of Luffy’s eyes, killing him in favor. 
     Grief overcame him and Luffy could not protect his only brother, and recognising the harsh truth, he was still too weak to stand against
      the world’s strongest. Luffy was shattered and lost, as Blackbeard rose and terrorised the world with his name replacing Whitebeard’s. 
      But this moment of despair brought him to a new direction; he needed to become stronger, not just for himself, but for his crew, 
      his family, and the dream he carried forward.</p>
