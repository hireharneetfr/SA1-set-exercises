<h2 id="abc"> OVERVIEW</h2>

<p id="def">Eiichiro Oda is the creator of one of the most known Japanese manga series, 'One Piece'. First published in 1997, it became one of the best selling manga series globally. The story focuses on Monkey D. Luffy, a young pirate who has an extraordinary ability to stretch his body like rubber after it swallowed a mystical fruit called Devil Fruit. Luffy's goal is to come and discover the legendary treasure The "One Piece" and become the King of The Pirates.Besides the manga, One Piece is also adapted into a highly successful anime series, starting from 1999. However, it has been ongoing for years, and has amassed a massive fan base all throughout the world, which, accordingly, made One Piece one of the longest-running anime TV shows of all time.</p>
<br>
<p id="def">In One Piece, Devil Fruits are rare, mystical fruits that grant unique powers at the cost of losing the ability to swim. They are divided into three types: Paramecia, which alters the body or grants special abilities; Logia, which allows control over natural elements; and Zoan, which enables animal transformations. These fruits play a key role in the series, shaping the battles and adventures of many characters.</p>

<h2><b>Review By Me</b></h2>
<p>One piece has more then 1000 episodes but my favorite of it all was the 'MarineFord Arc'.</p>
<p>One of the most destructive and highly action battle in One Piece, the Marineford Arc is definitely a close to points in Luffy’s journey. 
    Because he found out that his brother, Portgas D. Ace, was caught up by the Marines and will be sentenced to execution, Luffy has escaped 
    Impel Down exhausted, but he still goes to the deadliest battlefield — Marineford — to save him. Weak as the monstrous forces present, Luffy 
    had no other family but his crew and he was alone and apart from them. Whitebeard and his entire pirate fleet clash with the Marines, Admirals,
     Warlords in a chaotic and bloody brawl. Alongside legendary figures, Luffy had fought beyond all limits to free Ace, and with the victory 
     beginning to settle upon them, Admiral Akainu instigated dropping the dead body of Ace in front of Luffy’s eyes, killing him in favor. 
     Grief overcame him and Luffy could not protect his only brother, and recognising the harsh truth, he was still too weak to stand against
      the world’s strongest. Luffy was shattered and lost, as Blackbeard rose and terrorised the world with his name replacing Whitebeard’s. 
      But this moment of despair brought him to a new direction; he needed to become stronger, not just for himself, but for his crew, 
      his family, and the dream he carried forward.</p>
