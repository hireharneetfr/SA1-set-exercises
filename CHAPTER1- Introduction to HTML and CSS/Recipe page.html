     <p> Chicken Tikka Masala is a curried dish with grilled chicken chunks simmered in a flavorful tomato-onion masala sauce. 
        "Tikka" means a chunk, <br> 
        referring to marinated chicken grilled to perfection before being mixed into the creamy, smoky, 
         and aromatic sauce. <br>

        Originally from Northern India, tikka kebabs were traditionally cooked in tandoors over charcoal. The dish evolved into 
        a fusion of Indian and <br> British cuisine, becoming a popular curry in the UK.</p>
